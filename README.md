MPU-Net (Modality Preservation U-Net) is a deep learning network for multimodal medical image segmentation.
The MPU-Net implementation is based on PyTorch and nnU-Net and can be easily integrated into other training architectures.
Image reading, preprocessing and model training can be done using popular frameworks such as MONAI or nnU-Net or any custom framework.
